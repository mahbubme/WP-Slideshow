## üíª Development Procedure

Please follow the development guidelines to extend the plugin functionalities or to fix any bug/issue of this plugin.

- Add the following line in your wp-config.php file. `SCRIPT_DEBUG` is a related constant that will force WordPress to use the `dev` versions of core CSS and JavaScript files. This is useful when you are testing modifications to any built-in .js or .css files.

`define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );`

- Use command line to change your working directory to plugin's directory: 

`cd /path-to-plugins-directory/wp-slideshow`

- You must initialize the development environment using composer and npm:

`npm install` 

`composer install`

- You need to check the JavaScript codes to detect errors and potential problems. After making any changes to plugin's JavaScript files run the following command.   

`npm run lint:js`

- To fix the JavaScript fixable errors automatically:

`npm run lint-fix:js` 

- To detect violations of pre-defined PHP & WordPress coding standards(WPCS):

`composer run:cs`

- To resolve the fixable PHP & WPCS errors:

`composer fix:cbf`

- Initialize the testing environment

Please make sure that you have [mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) running in your computer. Replace `<username>` `<password>` with your mysql username and password. If you don't have password setup then leave the `<password>` with `''` syntax. 

`bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh tests-wp-slideshow <username> <password> localhost latest`

- Start Testing

Run PHPUnit. You can add more tests to the `tests` directory as well. 

`composer run:phpunit`

- Plugin build process

Run the following command, commmit the changes and push to [Github](https://github.com/mahbubme/WP-Slideshow/). Replace `<version>` with any of the value(e.g: `v2.4.0`)

`./vendor/bin/robo release <version>`

Note: when you make a code change and push to GitHub, a build will be triggered on Travis CI.
